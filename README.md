WebFX
=====
The purpose of this project is to investigate the capabilities of using JavaFX (FXML + JS + CSS) to build rich web pages, instead of using HTML.

Idea is to build an FX browser, a security layer, a navigation scheme where one FXML can tell the browser to go to another FXML and a protocol for server-side communication.

Steps
=====
1. Start the WebFX application
2. Type "example.fxml" on the URL box
3. Press FX!
